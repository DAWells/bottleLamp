# Bottle lamp

## Project aim
Make a colourful lamp housed in an old bottle. This lamp is powered
by an arduino Pro Micro (5V). Connecting this board to the arduino
IDE is described on this sparkfun
[post](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pro-micro--fio-v3-hookup-guide/all#example-1-blinkies). The LEDs are a strip of individually 
addressable WS2812B 5050 LEDs. The data pin is pin 7 and uses a 
330 Ohm resistor.
